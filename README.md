# TomatoTeam Project

#1 Alcohol-Recommender Quiz [Primary] -
We have created a quiz to help pair users with alcohol that suits their tastes.
We begin by asking the user if they're 21 or older. If the user is under 21, they are provided an array of non-alcoholic choices.
For users over 21, they are given options of liquor, wine and beer.
For liquor, the user is given the options of several types of liquor to choose from, and from there is given a large assortment of drinks made from that.
For beer and wine, the user is given the option of what type of food they want to pair with their drink. Based off that choice, we give the user drinks that would pair well with their food.

#2 Drink/Food Delivery with Postmates API[Secondary]
Under Construction - we hope to revisit this feature after we learn how to use Node.
